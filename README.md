Description

This progam uses Google maps API and Chicago's crime rates to find the safest route to your destination in Chicago. One limitation to Google maps API is that they will only give a total of 3 routes from one origin to one destination. The program then calculates the safest of these three routes and displays your route instructions and route safety weight. 

Documentation

One piece of documentation that I found quite helpfull can be found at:

Directions

To install the Google maps API run the following command in the terminal:

$ sudo pip install -U googlemaps

You will also need to get your own Google API key. You can do this by going to the following link:
